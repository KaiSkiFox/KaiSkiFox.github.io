### Welcome to "Subsidiary Code Space." 

This website and things related is a personal passion project. The coding projects I've listed here are either inspired or required from my work.
Thank you for checking it out!  
The order of the projects is not in chronological order, but rather the order in which I've published them.
The website is still new, and will look raw, but I'll update them as time goes on!
